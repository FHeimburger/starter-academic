I am an historian of warfare and languages who completed a PhD at the [EHESS Paris](https://www.ehess.fr/fr) under the joint supervision of [Christophe Prochasson](https://www.ehess.fr/fr/personne/christophe-prochasson) (EHESS Paris) and [John Horne](http://johnhorne.ie/biography/) (Trinity College Dublin) on languages in Allied coalition warfare during the First World War. Since September 2015 I have been working at the [English department of Sorbonne Université, Faculté des Lettres](https://lettres.sorbonne-universite.fr/faculte-des-lettres/ufr/langues/etudes-anglophones), as part of the [HDEA research group](http://hdea.paris-sorbonne.fr/).

I like to call myself a French historian with British and German nationalities. After secondary school in Germany and a B.A. in England I have lived and worked in Paris on and off since 2005, first spending three years at the [École Normale Supérieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/) while gaining a Masters in history at the EHESS (obtained in 2007), and then working towards my PhD.

I currently teach British History and IT Skills to students working towards English degrees at Sorbonne Université. In the past, I have taught German and Anglo-American Historiography seminars, as well as general methodology courses, as well as quantitative history and I.T. skills to budding historians in various settings. See the blog I run jointly with [Emilien Ruiz](https://e-ruiz.com/): [La boîte à outils des historiens](https://www.boiteaoutils.info/).
