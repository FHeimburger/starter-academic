This workshop has two complementary objectives. Firstly, to familiarize participants with the different possible uses of quantification in history; to introduce participants to the possibilities offered by statistical analysis in historical writing. The ambition is both practical (to introduce the use of various methods) and theoretical (to provide the elements necessary for an informed reading of work using quantitative techniques). Secondly, this workshop aims to enable participants to take the measure and develop a critical reading of the digital transformations of history over the last twenty years.
