summary: An intellectual born of the First World War?.
abstract: "Works especially by Christophe Prochasson (1993; 1996; 2004) and Martha Hanna (1996), but also more recently and more peripherally by Nicolas Beaupré (2006) and Charles Ridel (2008) have widened and deepened our understanding of what it meant to be an intellectual during the First World War.
The case we intend to study for this paper does not fit neatly into the established categories of shirker intellectuals who wrote about the war from Paris or combatant intellectuals who risked their lives in the front lines. As a military interpreter working for the British Army, he existed between these categories while encompassing aspects of all of them. Our wider research on these go-between figures will enable us to examine closely this little-studied aspect of Maurois' biography.
Maurois' war experience left a multitude of traces reaching from the translation of Ian Hay's novel The First Hundred Thousand (1915b; the translation was published as: 1915a)  into French, the documents of  the French military administration, his private correspondence, the fictionalised account of his experience published as Les silences du Colonel Bramble  all the way to his memoirs  written at the very end of his life. Using a wide range of analytical approaches, including methods from translation studies, eminently suited to this topic, we intend to reconstruct this particular experience of the War which was in a certain way foundational for Maurois' existence as an intellectual. He might well have continued after the war as the Normandy textile industrial Emile Herzog he had been before, had it not been for the literary success of his fictionalised account of the War  and the shadow and the memory of the War thus continue to bear on him throughout his life."
