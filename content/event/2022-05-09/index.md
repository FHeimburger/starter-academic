#summary: An exploration of the dimension of coalition war for this little-studied conflict.
abstract: James Moncrieff Grierson (1859-1914) had a long and illustrious military career which saw roles in military Intelligence as well as several other postings at home and abroad. Douglas Haig, in the preface to his 1922 biography described him as “not only an extremely well-trained Staff Officer, but also an able commander of troops and a skilful artilleryman.”  We intend to study precisely the transitions which saw Grierson alternate active duty postings in war zones (Egypt in 1882, Sudan 1885, China and South Africa in 1900) with duties in military intelligence and strategic planning (at Army Headquarters Intelligence in 1888, in Berlin as military attaché from 1898-1900, as Director Military Operations back at Army Headquarters from 1904). A talented linguist, prolific writer, and recognized authority on the German army in particular , Grierson worked alongside the Germans in the international coalition in China in 1900-1901 before playing a key role in the Anglo-French negotiations from 1905 onwards and our particular focus will be on his use of his language and cultural skills in coalition negotiation.
