#summary: An exploration of the dimension of coalition war for this little-studied conflict.
#abstract: While there has been considerable work on interwar internationalist and/or pacifist movements in general and on veterans in those structures in particular, there has not been much work on the specific role of FWW cultural intermediaries in the interwar period.

#During the First World War French military interpreters served alongside the British and American troops to both facilitate their logistical experience of warfare and to cover liaison needs between adjacent units. They form a fascinating body of intercultural mediators as they are at once clearly identified with a specific uniform, yet also trained almost exclusively on the job with no prior preparation before the war. While their exact number cannot be determined due to disparities in the conservation of archival sources produced in various military bases, it is safe to say that we are talking about at least 6-8000 individuals.

#We are in the fortunate position of being able to investigate their post-war roles through two separate and complementary avenues - on the one hand a small number of public intellectual figures including André Maurois, Victor Huguet, and Paul Mantoux become respected authorities on Britain in general and Anglo-French relations in particular. Their publications give us insight into the public role of the intercultural mediator in the interwar years. On the other hand, two separate veterans’ associations for military interpreters provide comradeship but also practical assistance as linguistic exchanges are sought for the children of military interpreters and a variety of bi- and international events organised.

#This enables us to better understand how wartime cultural intermediaries go on to act in the international sphere afterwards, creating continuities in peacetime from their wartime roles.
