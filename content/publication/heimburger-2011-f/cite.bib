 abstract = {This paper investigates the status, the functioning and the organisation of the British officers' mess on the Western Front. What is usually considered a specifically British space is shown to be engaged in multiple levels of interaction, negotiation, and exchange with the surrounding reality of allied warfare. Three particular elements are considered: first of all the negotiations necessary to obtain rooms for an officers' mess, secondly the wide spectre of activities which were conducted inside the mess, and finally the hierarchical and social composition of the mess, with particular regard to the French military interpreters. By studying the activities and margins of exchange of the regimental officers at battalion level, we can get a hold on coalition warfare at a much lower level than high-command communication.},
