abstract: "This paper investigates the status, the functioning and the organisation\
  \ of the British officers' mess on the Western Front. What is usually considered\
  \ a specifically British space is shown to be engaged in multiple levels of interaction,\
  \ negotiation, and exchange with the surrounding reality of allied warfare. Three\
  \ particular elements are considered: first of all the negotiations necessary to\
  \ obtain rooms for an officers' mess, secondly the wide spectre of activities which\
  \ were conducted inside the mess, and finally the hierarchical and social composition\
  \ of the mess, with particular regard to the French military interpreters. By studying\
  \ the activities and margins of exchange of the regimental officers at battalion\
  \ level, we can get a hold on coalition warfare at a much lower level than high-command\
  \ communication."
