abstract: This volume presents translation as a powerful activity by revisiting the
  roles of translators and interpreters and the contexts of translation and interpreting
  in societies affected by globalisation and migration. The articles in this volume
  cover topics such as the impact languages have on translation, the institutional
  constraints in the context of translation, and the challenges within the framework
  of multimodal translation. In recent years, questions of power in translation have
  emerged. In such a context, the contributions of this volume present new research
  paths that can be related to some of the most discussed issues of recent years in
  Translation Studies. The contributors are 14 PhD students who investigate the power
  relations in the context of censorship, ideology, localisation, multimodal translation,
  English as a lingua franca in translation, mandatory genres and translation by non-professional
  subject-matter translators.
