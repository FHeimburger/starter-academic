abstract: French military interpreters attached to the British troops during the First
  World War often experienced considerable difficulty in explaining their position
  even to close relatives. They felt the need to justify the fact that they were not
  exposed to the same immediate danger as most of their French comrades in arms. Furthermore,
  their daily work in ensuring the military coalition ran smoothly was mostly unintelligible
  to their contemporaries. This paper explores the different strategies employed by
  three interpreters in choosing photographs to convey aspects of the role in personal
  communications to their family. The analysis necessarily includes questions on power
  relations as experienced by these rank-and-file soldiers whose specific tasks led
  them to work almost exclusively alongside British officers, their hybrid status
  exemplified by their uniform, which combines elements from both national traditions,
  and their conception of the corps of military interpreters as a specific and cohesive
  unit. Our work in the French military archives on the individual interpreters' case
  files enables us to combine a close reading of the images with surrounding background
  information on their previous experience and social standing.
