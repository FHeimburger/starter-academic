abstract: Out of the thousands of Frenchmen who attempted to join the 1848– 49 Italian
  revolution movement, more than 1,200 actually played a significant role in the various
  revolutionary struggles. Based on the investigation of the participation of the
  French volunteers in the Italian revolutions of 1848– 49, this article shows that
  the 1848 revolutions were European not in the sense that they spread across Europe
  simultaneously, but because of the presence of international volunteers who were
  constantly moving from one part of Europe to another. The enlistment of volunteers
  in France for the 1848 Italian cause is examined in terms of the circulation of
  political and military models that were inspired both by the idea of the `Fraternity
  of the Peoples' in 1848 but also by an older tradition of French military involvement
  in Italy and Europe. The little-known case of the French volunteers who went to
  fight in Sicily in 1849, first `Expedition of the Thousand', provides a case study
  for explaining the enthusiasm that the French volunteers showed for the Italian
  cause.
